# Diocletianomics
An economic engine simulation hoping to recreate the structures of the late Roman economy

// Things I would like to add support for
- Natural system of pricing goods
- Regional markets and interconnectivity metrics
- Slavery and aristocratic influence
- Taxation and defense
- Non monopolistic firms and price getting (maybe...)
