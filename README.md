- Database supports for simpler viz
- UML diagram for SQL support...
- Firm value estimations / cash flows
- Ownership and property confiscations
- State collapse and reconstruction
- Disasters + civil wars
- Barriers to entry
- Firm management structure / nested levels
- 2D array productivity representation
- Inheritance and learning
