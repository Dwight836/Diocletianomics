An economic engine simulation hoping to recreate the structures of the late Roman economy

// Things I would like to add support for
- Regional markets and interconnectivity metrics
- Slavery and aristocratic influence
- Taxation and defense
- Random shock events such as invasion, plague, etc.
- Firm reinvestments in labor vs. capital
- Simple dashboard for basic stats (Tableau, possibly?)
- Natural firm creation
- Database supports for simpler viz
